Many of the models in this folder only work in pairs--i.e. the main model is 
a Python file, but the job script is only going to call a bash file or 
executable. In order to get around this, use e.g. equilibriate.sh as the 'script'
argument in tasks.crwl, and relax.py as an 'extra' argument in tasks.crwl.
