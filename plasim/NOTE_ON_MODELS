Many of the models in this folder only work in pairs--i.e. the main model is 
a Python file, but the job script is only going to call a bash file or 
executable. In order to get around this, use e.g. equilibriate.sh as the 'script'
argument in tasks.crwl, and relax.py as an 'extra' argument in tasks.crwl.
What this does is simply tells crawler that it's going to need to copy the 'extra' 
file into the job folder, and that the submission script should run the 'script'
file.
