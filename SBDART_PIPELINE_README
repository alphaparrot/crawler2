  README : USING THE EXOPLASIM PIPELINE
============================================

Note: the version of SBDART being distributed 
here is what was available in zipped form on 
the internet in early 2017. It does not 
represent the most up-to-date version of 
SBDART, and I take no responsibility for its 
proper functioning. I am not maintaining this 
version of SBDART, and encourage users to 
incorporate updated versions of SBDART when 
those releases are stable. -AP

Using the ExoPlaSim pipeline


Starting with the January 16, 2020 release of
crawler2, code is available to create ExoPlaSim
runs that automatically proceed on to SBDART
postprocessing, and then to the collector code
that stitches everything together. Finally,
the colormatching and orthoprojection codes are
also included, which can be used to translate
SBDART spectral maps into true-color images.

To use this mode, simply include the "sbdart"
field in the ExoPlaSim job header. The argument
should take the form {0,1,2}|{Z,N,E,W,S}, where
the first list in braces is a list of integers
corresponding to the substellar points you want.
In the current code, options are 0--3. You must
specify at least one in the form {0,}. The 
second list in braces is the viewer orientation:
Zenith, North, East, West, or South. This list
should be any combination of these (i.e. {Z,}).
The minimal case is therefore {0,}|{Z,}. All
but the zenith orientations represent quarter
phases. Zenith has the viewer in the same
position as the star, corresponding to a full
phase. There is no need to further specify
whether you are using the Earth-like or tidally-
locked variant; the code will determine which
is appropriate based on the ExoPlaSim job you
have created.
